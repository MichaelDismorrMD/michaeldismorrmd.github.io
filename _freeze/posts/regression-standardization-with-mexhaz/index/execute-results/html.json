In future posts, I will also cover how to achieve this using the `rstpm2`, `stdReg`, and `marginaleffects` packages for various outcome measures, including in a competing risk setting.\n\nFirst, let's discuss what regression standardization is and why it is useful. As you may know, a common method to analyze and visualize survival data is by constructing a Kaplan-Meier curve. Since Kaplan-Meier estimates are crude, these curves are often combined with a hazard ratio from a Cox regression to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in survival between treatment groups.\n\nOne way to provide \"adjusted\" survival curves is by stratifying, i.e., creating several Kaplan-Meier curves based on a categorical variable, such as age over or under 50. While this approach might be appropriate in certain cases, it is not feasible to adjust for many covariates this way or for continuous covariates, as it would produce numerous curves with very few patients represented in each.\n\nAnother option is to calculate a survival curve from a hazard model, such as Cox regression. This involves fitting a model and using it to predict a survival curve at different follow-up times. For example, we could predict survival for a 50-year-old man with Treatment A and diabetes, and then draw the same curve for a 50-year-old man with Treatment B and diabetes. Although this estimates survival for a particular individual, it is incorrect to assume that using mean values (such as mean age) will yield a mean effect estimate for the population under study. To estimate the treatment effect in the population, we can instead use regression standardization.\n\nThis involves fitting a hazard model using the entire population. We then predict survival for each individual in the study under the alternative treatment options. First, we re-code everyone to have received Treatment A and predict individual estimates. Next, we assign everyone to have received Treatment B and predict individual estimates. Finally, we average the estimates at each time point within the group to obtain population mean estimates.\n\nNow, let's implement this in R. We will start by simulating a dataset of 1000 patients with Treatment A or B, with or without diabetes, who either died or survived during follow-up.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nset.seed(12345)\n\nn <- 1000\n\ndata <- data.frame(\n  age = c(sample(60:89, n/2, replace = TRUE), sample(45:74, n/2, replace = TRUE)),\n  treatment = rep(c(\"Treatment A\", \"Treatment B\"), each = n/2),\n  sex = sample(c(\"Male\", \"Female\"), n, replace = TRUE),\n  diabetes = sample(0:1, n, replace = TRUE)\n) %>%\n  # Shuffle the rows to mix Treatment A and Treatment B groups\n  slice_sample(n = n) %>%\n  # Generate follow-up time, depending on treatment group and age. \n  mutate(follow_up_time = round(ifelse(treatment == \"Treatment A\",\n                                       rexp(n, rate = 1 / (1200 - (age - 45) * 4)),\n                                       rexp(n, rate = 1 / (1200 - (age - 45) * 8)))),\n         follow_up_time = ifelse(follow_up_time == 0, 1, follow_up_time), \n         follow_up_years = follow_up_time / 365.25,\n         # Event probability increases with age\n         event = rbinom(n, 1, prob = plogis((age - 45) / 10)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's do a regular Kaplan-Meier analysis first.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(ggsurvfit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\nmyCols <- c(\"Difference\" = \"#7570b3\", \n            \"Treatment A\" = \"#1b9e77\", \n            \"Treatment B\" = \"#e7298a\")\n\nsurvfit2(Surv(follow_up_years, event) ~ treatment, data = data) %>% \n  ggsurvfit(key_glyph = \"rect\", linewidth = 0.8) + \n  add_pvalue(location = \"annotation\") + \n  scale_ggsurvfit(x_scales = list(limits = c(0, 10), \n                                  breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 2))) + \n  theme_pubr() + \n  add_risktable() + \n  scale_color_manual(aesthetics = c(\"fill\", \"color\"), \n                     values = myCols, \n                     breaks = c(\"Treatment B\", \"Treatment A\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere it seems like patients who received Treatment B had better survival compared to patients who received Treatment A (p = 0.006).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoxph(Surv(follow_up_years, event) ~ treatment + age + diabetes, data = data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCall:\ncoxph(formula = Surv(follow_up_years, event) ~ treatment + age + \n    diabetes, data = data)\n\n                         coef exp(coef) se(coef)     z        p\ntreatmentTreatment B 0.196873  1.217589 0.091265 2.157    0.031\nage                  0.026941  1.027308 0.004122 6.536 6.32e-11\ndiabetes             0.108292  1.114373 0.069194 1.565    0.118\n\nLikelihood ratio test=53.02  on 3 df, p=1.819e-11\nn= 1000, number of events= 843 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter adjusting for age using Cox regression, we now see that Treatment B is associated with an increased risk of death compared to Treatment A (HR: 1.22, p = 0.03).\nNot let's analyse this using regression standardization.\nFirst, we fit a hazard model using the `mexhaz()` function.

The solid line represents the point estimate, and the shaded area indicates the 95% confidence interval. Since the difference does not cross the 0-line, we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference (i.e., the difference is zero).\n\nThis approach offers several advantages over simply reporting the hazard ratio (HR) from a Cox model. It provides estimates throughout the follow-up period, making it easier to interpret the treatment effect. Additionally, we can visualize how the difference evolves over time, often showing a trend toward a smaller difference at the end of the follow-up.\n\nThis example demonstrates a straightforward way to perform regression standardization. However, in a real analysis, one must consider various factors, such as model specification (e.g., variable selection, non-linear terms, interaction terms), handling of missing data, and the appropriateness of the method for the specific setting.\n\nIn the next post, we will explore how to achieve regression standardization using the `rstpm2` package.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
