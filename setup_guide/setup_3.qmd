title: "Installing Homebrew"
---

Now it's time to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). 
Homebrew is a packet manager, and you can use it as a command in your terminal to install other programs needed for development, including other commands.  

First, go to the Homebrew webpage on <https://brew.sh>.
Then, click on the clipboard icon to the left where I have marked the image "Click here"

Then, open you terminal. This program can be found in your Applications folder, but it is often faster to use Spotlight
by pressing {{< kbd Command+Space >}} and then typing `terminal`. Then select the Terminal application and press {{< kbd Enter >}}.

Now, paste in the command you copied from the Homebrew webpage by pressing {{< kbd Command+V >}} and then press {{< kbd Enter >}}.  
You might be promted to enter your computer password, do this and then press {{< kbd Enter >}}. 

::: {.callout-warning}
## Beware
You will not see that you are entering anything in the terminal, that's the default look when entering sensitive information such as passwords. 
Don't try and enter it again, as it will be entered two times.

If no errors were encountered, you have now successfully installed the `brew` command.
