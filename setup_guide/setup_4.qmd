Now, we will use `brew` to install the github command-line program, [`gh-cli`](https://cli.github.com/manual/).
This command line program will allow you to login, sync, and clone the repositories you have access to on GitHub. 

Type `brew install gh` in your terminal and press {{< kbd Enter >}}.

When the command finishes, type `gh auth login` in the terminal. 
This will log you in to your github account. Chose GitHub, HTTPS, Yes to authenticate git, and login via browser.
