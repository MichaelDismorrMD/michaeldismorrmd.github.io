title: "Installing RStudio"

Now, it's finally time to install RStudio. 
Go to <https://posit.co>, and click on "Download Rstudio". 
Don't click the button that says "Download Rstudio Server", but use the regular desktop version.

Since you have already installed R, go ahead and click on "Download Rstudio Desktop for macOS 12+"

Drag the RStudio icon into your Applications folder. Once the installation finishes, eject the .dmg file and move it to the trash. 

Then open RStudio either by double clicking on the RStudio icon in the Applications folder, or using spotlight by pressing {{< kbd Command+Space >}} and typing `rstudio`.

## Note
If you don't use spotlight often, the first time you use it, it might take some time to find the applications you're looking for.
This will be much faster the next time you use it, and definitely faster than clicking your way through finder to your Applications folder.
