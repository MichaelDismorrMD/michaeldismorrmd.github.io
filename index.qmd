## About me

I am a M.D., PhD and postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in the cardiothoracic surgery research group. 

This page has been migrated from using `blogdown` and Netlify, to Quarto and github pages.

Here I will primarily post guides and tutorials related to epidemiology in R. Topics will range from survival analysis with regression standardization and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to more workflow related guides. Feel free to reach out with comments or suggestions.  

The [blog](blog_start.qmd) section covers short tutorial-style posts, mostly regarding biostatistics and survival analysis in R.  
The [guides](guides/guides.qmd) section is aimed towards new members of our research group (and anyone else who finds the information helpful), and is more "course styled".
