## About

I am a M.D., PhD and postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in the cardiothoracic surgery research group. 

Here I will primarily post guides and tutorials related to epidemiology in R. Topics will range from survival analysis with regression standardization and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to more workflow related guides. Feel free to reach out with comments or suggestions.
