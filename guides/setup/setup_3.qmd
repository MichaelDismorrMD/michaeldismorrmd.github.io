Now it's time to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh){target="_blank"}. 
Homebrew is a packet manager, and you can use it as a command in your terminal to install other programs needed for development, including other commands.  

First, go to the Homebrew webpage on <https://brew.sh>{target="_blank"}.
Then, click on the clipboard icon to the left where I have marked the image "Click here"

Then, open you terminal. This program can be found in your Applications folder, but it is often faster to use Spotlight
by pressing {{< kbd Command+Space >}} and then typing `terminal`. Then select the Terminal application and press {{< kbd Enter >}}.

Now, paste in the command you copied from the Homebrew webpage by pressing {{< kbd Command+V >}} and then press {{< kbd Enter >}}.  
You might be prompted to enter your computer password, do this and then press {{< kbd Enter >}}.

## Note
You will not see that you are entering anything in the terminal, that's the default look when entering sensitive information such as passwords. 
Don't try and enter it again, as it will be entered two times.

If no errors were encountered, you have now successfully installed the `brew` command. 
You might be prompted to run some commands to add Homebrew to your path. In that case, just cope-paste them and run them one by one.
While we are in the terminal, let's prepare a folder structure we will use later on.
First, we will create the `my_git` folder where all yours and others projects will be placed. 
```{.bash filename="Create my_git folder"}
mkdir my_git
```

Then, we will move into that folder, and create a new folder with your first name. This is where we will create your first project later.
```{.bash filename="Create your folder within the my_git folder"}
cd my_git
mkdir Michael
```
