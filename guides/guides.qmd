Welcome to the guides page. 

These guides are aimed at members and students at our research group, and in general does not fit in in the blog section. 
However, they might still be of help to others who face similar problems. We belive this workflow is simple and efficient for beginners.  

The first section [(Setup)](#setup) is intended to aid in setting up the necessary software to work with R efficiently. 

The second section [(New project)](#new-project) showcases a workflow I prefer when starting new projects. 

And the third section [(Collaborate)](#collaborate) shows a suggested workflow when working with others on the same project.
