title: "Clone project using gh-cli"
---

This section will guide you through how to set up when you've been invited to collaborate on a new project. 
As I mentioned in the previous section, I like to keep a folder structure to keep track of the repo owner, that is, who created and likely leads the project. 
If I have invited you to collaborate, you should make sure you have a folder like this `~/my_git/Michael`. 

First, open your terminal using spotlight by pressing {{< kbd "Command+Space" >}} and type in terminal.

Type `ls` to confirm the `my_git` folder exists. If it does type `cd my_git` to go into it, otherwise first type `mkdir my_git` to create it. 
Once in the `my_git` folder, type `ls` again to see if the `Michael` folder exists, otherwise create it using `mkdir` and go into it using `cd`.

Now, we are going to clone to repository to our computer. If you already know the GitHub name and repo name that you have been invited to, you can type:
```{.bash}
gh repo clone Username/repo_name
```

I often find myself not knowing either the username nor the repo name, so I list all repos I have access to using the `repo-name` alias we set up in the [Setup Guide](../setup/setup_4.qmd). 

```{.bash}
gh repo-names
```

Once it has finished cloning, go into the `repo_name` folder and then open RStudio.
```{.bash}
cd repo-name
open repo-name.RProj
```
