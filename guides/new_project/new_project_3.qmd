Optionally, you might chose to use `pak` as the package manager with `renv`.
`pak` can download packages in parallel, and will speed up both `renv::restore()` and `renv::install()`.

Basically, you just open the `.Rprofile` in the root of your project folder, and add the line

```{r}
#| eval: false
options(renv.config.pak.enabled = TRUE)
```

before the 
```{r}
#| eval: false
source("renv/activate.R")
```
