title: "Using the usethis package"
---

First, we use spotlight to open RStudio (unless it's already open).

In the upper right corner, it should say `Project: (None)`. 
Now, we will use the `usethis` package to create a new project, track it with git, and upload it to GitHub. 

In the console, write: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::create_project("my_git/subfolder/project_name")
```

This will create and open a new R-project in `~/my_git/subfolder/project_name`. The folder structure is up to you, personally, I like to keep all git-repos in sub-folders of `my_git`, and where `subfolder` is the name of the repo owner, so in this case it would be `~/my_git/Michael/project_name`. 

In the console of the newly opened R-Studio (which now should have `project_name` in the upper right corner), write:
```{r}
#| eval: false

usethis::use_git()
```

Next, link it to Github (use option `private = T` if you want to create a private repo):

```{r}
#| eval: false

usethis::use_github(private = T)
```


Now you are ready to create your first file, press {{< kbd "Shift+Command+p" >}} and select `Create a New R Script`.
I recommend keeping track of dependencies using `renv`, so install any packages needed by typing in the Console: 

```{r}
#| eval: false

renv::install("dplyr")
```

When finishing for the day, register all new packages with `renv::snapshot()`, save and close R-Studio, and then in the terminal do `git add .`, `git commit -m "Begining on my new project`, and last `git push`. 

That marks the end of this guide. In the following section, I will demonstrate a suggested workflow when being invited to collaborate on a project.
