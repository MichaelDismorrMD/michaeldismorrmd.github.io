title: "Using the usethis package"
---

First, we use spotlight to open RStudio (unless it's already open). 

![Open RStudio](spotlight_rstudio.png)

In the upper right corner, it should say `Project: (None)`. 
Now, we will use this `usethis` package to create a new project, track it with git, and upload it to GitHub. 

In the console, write: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::create_project()
```
